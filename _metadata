Current list of features:

Dialog fixes where dialog was sloppy and generic, made it slightly more robust. "I have nothing to say to you." has been REMOVED.
Many NPCs have a chance to spawn as any avaiable species. Want your species included in this? Instructions can be found as a part of the MRMT suite.
Dungeons are more full of more npcs! The protectorate accademy and outpost are more lively, challenge encounters are more challenge!
